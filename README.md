# dnscrypt
Very basic DNSCrypt library for go.

See [DNSCryptClient](https://github.com/willnix/DNSCryptClient) for a simple demo or [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/willnix/dnscrypt) for documentation.
The code also has lots of comments...

#### *DISCLAIMER:*
I wrote this to understand the protocol before implementing it in a language I am much less familiar with.
It is not feature complete, but should work with most DNSCrypt resolvers.
I tried not to make stupid mistakes and I think it behaves reasonably secure but please be careful!
